---- Rigout Pickout ---- 

---- Project Description ----

Rigout Pickout is a Shopify app that will attract new customers and enable them to make purchases from the business, increasing revenue.
The app helps users create outfits in various methods based on the shop's inventory. Rigout Pickout has three options for outfit creation: Curated,
Manual, and Random. Each of these modes is represented by a different page, which the user can navigate freely between.

On the Curated page, the user can select different style attributes they desire in their outfit. The app will then select an outfit based off of the 
criteria, or notify the user if there is no match for their selection. 

On the Manual page, the user will select their own outfit manually using carousels, and will submit their selection to view their outfit in a single
photo and be able to shop for the items they are selecting.

On the Random page, the user will choose a percentage match that they want and the app will select a random outfit for them

---- Special Note on Hydrogen 1 and Hydrogen 2 with remix ----
{
    While initially the Rigout Pickout was built on Hydrogen 1, with the release of Hydrogen 2 with remix, new bugs, and features have been introduced.
    Which has had a strong negative impact on the original application, we apologize for any errors that result, from the new hydrogen """""update""""".
    The methods that were used to start development on the Rigout Pickout and the code that was used in the application had to be retrofitted.
    With that said the method for starting and installing the application should be relatively similar, the different processes have been added below.
    It definitely should be noted that the process to work on and run a development build has become much more difficult.

---- Everything has been installed ----
{   
    Hydrogen 1 version : (Old Method)
        "npm install"
            To update dependencies
        "cd Socksandfrocks"
        "npm run dev"
            To run website
            NOTE:
                CarouselTest.js need to be rebuild each time at startup, after checking http://localhost:3000/, give a moment then reload webpage.
    
    Hydrogen 2 Version : (Current Method)
        "npm install"
            To install dependencies
        "cd Socksandfrocks"
        To run website
            "yarn build"
            "yarn preview"
        NOTE: 
            With the number of interconnections of packages and runtime environment and the relatively new update to Hydrogen.
            It may be very difficult to run a build that will work, without the version of software list in package.json and package-lock.json
