---- Rigout Pickout ---- 

---- Project Description ----

Rigout Pickout is a Shopify app that will attract new customers and enable them to make purchases from the business, increasing revenue.
The app helps users create outfits in various methods based on the shop's inventory. Rigout Pickout has three options for outfit creation: Curated,
Manual, and Random. Each of these modes is represented by a different page, which the user can navigate freely between.

On the Curated page, the user can select different style attributes they desire in their outfit. The app will then select an outfit based off of the 
criteria, or notify the user if there is no match for their selection. 

On the Manual page, the user will select their own outfit manually using carousels, and will submit their selection to view their outfit in a single
photo and be able to shop for the items they are selecting.

On the Random page, the user will choose a percentage match that they want and the app will select a random outfit for them
